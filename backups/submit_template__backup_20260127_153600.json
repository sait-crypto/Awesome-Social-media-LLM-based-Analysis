      "abstract": "Evaluating speaker emotion in conversations is crucial for various applications requiring human-computer interaction. However, co-occurrences of multiple emotional states (e.g. 'anger' and 'frustration' may occur together or one may influence the occurrence of the other) and their dynamic evolution may vary dramatically due to the speaker's internal (e.g., influence of their personalized socio-cultural-educational and demographic backgrounds) and external contexts. Thus far, the previous focus has been on evaluating only the dominant emotion observed in a speaker at a given time, which is susceptible to producing misleading classification decisions for difficult multi-labels during testing. In this work, we present Self-supervised Multi- Label Peer Collaborative Distillation (SeMuL-PCD) Learning via an efficient Multimodal Transformer Network, in which complementary feedback from multiple mode-specific peer networks (e.g.transcript, audio, visual) are distilled into a single mode-ensembled fusion network for estimating multiple emotions simultaneously. The proposed Multimodal Distillation Loss calibrates the fusion network by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence with the peer networks. Additionally, each peer network is conditioned using a self-supervised contrastive objective to improve the generalization across diverse socio-demographic speaker backgrounds. By enabling peer collaborative learning that allows each network to independently learn their mode-specific discriminative patterns,SeMUL-PCD is effective across different conversation environments. In particular, the model not only outperforms the current state-of-the-art models on several large-scale public datasets (e.g., MOSEI, EmoReact and ElderReact), but with around 17% improved weighted F1-score in the cross-dataset experimental settings. The model also demonstrates an impressive generalization ability across age and demography-diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "Expressed opinions on social media frequently cause a controversy. Controversial content refers to content that attracts different opinions and interrogations, implying interaction between communities. Its automatic identification remains a challenging task. Most of the existing approaches rely on the graph structure of discussion and/or the content of messages but did not deeply explore the recent advances on Graph Neural Network (gnn) to predict if a discussion is controversial or not. This paper aims to combine both user interactions present in the graph structure of a discussion and the discussion text features to detect controversy. We rely on sampling techniques to reduce the size of large graphs and augment the graph training set if needed. Our proposed approach relies then on gnn techniques to encode the initial (or sampled) graph in an embedding vector before performing a graph classification task. We propose two controversy detection strategies. The first one is based on a hierarchical graph representation learning to take advantage of hierarchical relationships that could exist between users. The second one is based on the attention mechanism, which allows each user node to give more or less importance to its neighbors when computing node embeddings. We present different experiments conducted with data sources collected from both Reddit and Twitter to show the applicability of our approach to different social networks. Conducted experiments show the positive impact of combining textual features and structural information in terms of performance and accuracy.",

      "notes": "[引用文]To better capture the dynamics of social polarization in the field of controversial content identification, Benslimane et al. (2023) shift from content-based analysis to a user-centric perspective. They argue that the structural relationships between users and the users' inherent attributes are pivotal for understanding controversy. Unlike traditional methods that treat posts as isolated nodes, their approach constructs a user interaction graph where node representations are derived by aggregating the semantic content of each user’s historical comments. This design encodes complex network information and individual stances into a unified feature space. By employing GNN methods such as Hierarchical Graph Representation Learning (HRL-GCN), the model performs multi-layer aggregation on the graph to capture high-level community structures, demonstrating that the fusion of user features with social interaction patterns provides an effective mechanism for controversy identification in social media.\n[翻译] 为了更好地在争议内容识别领域捕捉社会极化的动态，Benslimane等人 (2023) 的方法从基于内容的分析转变为以用户为中心视角。他们认为，用户之间的结构关系以及用户本身的属性对于理解争议至关重要。与将帖子视为孤立节点的传统方法不同，他们的方法构建了一个用户交互图，其中节点表示通过聚合每个用户历史评论的语义内容得到。这种设计将复杂的网络信息和个人立场编码到了统一的特征空间中。通过采用分层图表示学习（HRL-GCN）等GNN的方法，该模型对图进行多层聚合以捕捉高层级的社区结构，证明了用户特征与社交交互模式的融合为识别社交媒体中的争议识别提供了一种有效的机制。",

      "abstract": "Meme clustering is critical for toxicity detection, virality modeling, and typing, but it has received little attention in previous research. Clustering similar Internet memes is challenging due to their multimodality, cultural context, and adaptability. Existing approaches rely on databases, overlook semantics, and struggle to handle diverse dimensions of similarity. This paper introduces a novel method that uses template-based matching with multi-dimensional similarity features, thus eliminating the need for predefined databases and supporting adaptive matching. Memes are clustered using local and global features across similarity categories such as form, visual content, text, and identity. Our combined approach outperforms existing clustering methods, producing more consistent and coherent clusters, while similarity-based feature sets enable adaptability and align with human intuition. We make all supporting code publicly available to support subsequent research.",
